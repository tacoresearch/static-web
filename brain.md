# Project Brain File

## Current Status
- Directory structure already exists (content, templates, static, build, config)
- README.md exists as user documentation
- Planning document in planning/README.md
- TODO checklist in planning/todo.md

## Next Steps
Based on the checklist, we should implement:
1.2 Implement basic Markdown to HTML conversion
1.3 Create template system for consistent styling
1.4 Develop basic build script

## Implementation Plan
1. Create basic Markdown to HTML conversion functionality
2. Create template system
3. Create build script that uses both
4. Test the build process

## Technical Considerations
- Need to use Python for Markdown processing (as mentioned in README)
- Should handle various Markdown features
- Templates should be flexible and reusable
- Build script should be executable
